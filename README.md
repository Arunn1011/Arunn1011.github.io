## Project Overview

This project investigates the evolution of crime in San Francisco over the past two decades. By analyzing police incident reports from 2003 to 2024, we explore how crime trends have changed over time and across neighborhoods. The analysis focuses on “focus crimes” such as assault, burglary, robbery, larceny/theft, and drug violations, using both spatial and temporal approaches to understand the distribution and transformation of crime in the city.

The results are presented as an interactive data story, combining visualizations, geospatial mapping, and narrative insight.
