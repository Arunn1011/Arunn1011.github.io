  <h1>How Safe Is San Francisco Now?</h1>
  <p><em>A 20-Year Crime Retrospective</em></p>

  <section>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      Crime often feels like a constant. But <strong>has San Francisco actually become more or less dangerous over time?</strong> 
      Using over two decades of crime data, we explore how patterns have shifted — both in terms of volume and geography. 
      This story draws on a publicly available dataset from the San Francisco Police Department, covering over 20 years 
      of reported crimes from 2003 to 2024. The dataset includes incident-level records with information on date, time, 
      location, police district, and crime category. 
      <strong>We focus on “focus crimes” — such as assault, burglary, robbery, larceny/theft, drug violations, and other high-impact offenses.</strong>
      By analyzing these incidents across time and space, we aim to understand how the city’s safety landscape has evolved — 
      and where risk still lingers.

  <section>
    <h2>Total Reported Crime by Year</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      Over the past two decades, San Francisco's reported focus crimes have followed a trajectory that tells a deeper story. 
      <strong>In 2017, these crimes peaked — recording just over 90,000 incidents.</strong> It was a year marked by intense housing 
      pressures, growing inequality, and shifting enforcement priorities. 
      <strong>This spike raises questions: Was it a true surge in crime or a reflection of evolving reporting practices?</strong> 
      Regardless, 2017 remains the city's most crime-heavy year in two decades.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      What followed was unexpected. Crime began to decline after 2017, and by 2020, it plunged. 
      <strong>This sharp drop coincided with the COVID-19 pandemic</strong> — a time when life paused, public spaces emptied, and 
      crime opportunities diminished. But was this just a blip?
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Crime Trends After 2017</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      <strong>The data shows the dip in 2020 wasn't just temporary.</strong> While other cities saw crime rebound post-pandemic, 
      San Francisco’s focus crime numbers remained lower. 
      <strong>By 2024, they had dropped by over 33% from the 2017 peak.</strong>
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      This trend raises important questions: Has the city truly become safer? Are long-term policies, technological interventions, 
      or community efforts paying off? Or is it simply a change in how crime is reported and classified? 
      <strong>Though the dataset alone can’t offer definitive answers, one thing is clear: San Francisco’s crime rates are trending downward — steadily.</strong>
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      But if overall crime is falling, where is it still happening? <strong>To answer that, we need to look beyond timelines — and examine the map.</strong>

  <section>
    <h2>Where is Crime Concentrated in the City?</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      <strong>While overall crime has declined, the geography of crime tells a more nuanced story.</strong> 
      This map compares geolocated incidents from 2017 and 2024, categorizing them into:
    </p>
    <ul style="text-align: justify;">
      <li><strong>Persistent hotspots</strong> – Crime reported in both years</li>
      <li><strong>Improved areas</strong> – Crime only reported in 2017</li>
      <li><strong>Newly unsafe zones</strong> – Crime only reported in 2024</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      <strong>Downtown areas like the Tenderloin, SoMa, and eastern Mission remain persistent hotspots,</strong> while 
      other neighborhoods show improvement or newly emerging concerns.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Spatial Patterns of Change</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      The Mission continues to struggle — appearing as a persistent hotspot. In contrast, the Richmond, Sunset, and southern 
      residential districts show real progress, with fewer reported incidents in 2024. 
      <strong>However, crime hasn’t disappeared — it has shifted.</strong>
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      New hotspots are emerging in areas like the northern waterfront, Bayview, and peripheral zones. 
      <strong>This suggests a reshaping of risk, not its elimination.</strong> These shifts highlight the need for evolving policy responses.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h2>District Disparities: Mapping the Weight of Crime</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      <strong>Crime patterns differ dramatically across police districts.</strong> The Tenderloin and Southern districts consistently bear 
      a disproportionate share of reported incidents, while areas like Richmond and Taraval remain relatively calm.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      <strong>These disparities shape officer deployment, public perception, and policymaking.</strong> Understanding where crime concentrates 
      is essential for distributing resources fairly and crafting responsive strategies.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Conclusion: The Shape of Safety</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      <strong>San Francisco's crime landscape is changing — in volume, in space, and in complexity.</strong> While the data shows a hopeful 
      decline in focus crime over 20 years, it also reveals neighborhoods still under pressure and new ones emerging as risk zones.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      <strong>The city's safety story is not just about statistics — it's about geography.</strong> And understanding those geographies is 
      key to building a safer, more equitable San Francisco.

  <h1>How Safe Is San Francisco Now?</h1>
  <h1>A 20-Year Crime Retrospective</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    Crime often feels like a constant. But <strong>has San Francisco actually become more or less dangerous over time?</strong>
    Using over two decades of crime data, we take a closer look at how patterns have shifted — both in terms of volume and geography.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    This story draws on a publicly available dataset from the San Francisco Police Department, covering reported crimes from
    <strong>2003 to 2024</strong>. The data includes incident-level records across time, location, and crime categories.
    <strong>We focus on “focus crimes”</strong> — such as assault, burglary, robbery, larceny/theft, and drug violations.
    By analyzing these incidents through both spatial and temporal lenses, we uncover how the city’s safety landscape has evolved —
    and where risks still persist.
  </p>

  <h2>Crime Peaks and Pandemic Dips</h2>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    Over time, San Francisco’s focus crimes followed a dynamic trajectory.
    <strong>In 2017, reported crimes peaked with over 90,000 incidents</strong> — a year marked by housing crises, rising inequality,
    and shifting enforcement priorities. Was this surge due to more crime or more reporting? While that remains debatable,
    the data confirms: <strong>2017 was the city’s most crime-heavy year in two decades.</strong>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    Crime rates began to fall after 2017 — and then, in 2020, they plunged.
    <strong>This dramatic dip aligns with the COVID-19 pandemic</strong> and its global lockdown. Businesses shuttered, public spaces emptied,
    and crime opportunities diminished. Yet this disruption proved more than temporary.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    <strong>By 2024, focus crimes dropped over 33% from their 2017 peak.</strong> Unlike other cities that rebounded, San Francisco sustained its decline.
    This invites deeper questions: Is this a result of long-term reforms, evolving communities, or just reclassification?
    The data alone can't say — but <strong>the downward trend is undeniable.</strong>
  </p>

  </div>

  <h2>Where Is Crime Concentrated?</h2>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    While total crime has declined since 2017, <strong>the geographic story reveals uneven progress.</strong> Our hotspot analysis compares
    geolocated incidents in 2017 and 2024 using three categories:
  </p>
  <ul style="text-align: justify;">
    <li><strong>Persistent hotspots - marked in red</strong>: areas with crime in both years (e.g., Tenderloin, SoMa, Eastern Mission)</li>
    <li><strong>Improved areas - shown in green</strong>: locations that had crime in 2017 but not in 2024 (e.g., Richmond, Sunset)</li>
    <li><strong>New hotspots - shown in blue</strong>: areas with crime in 2024 but not in 2017 (e.g., northern waterfront, Bayview)</li>
  </ul>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    <strong>Persistent hotspots, highlight zones of chronic vulnerability.</strong> Improved areas show real reductions — not just in numbers but in space.
    However, crime hasn’t vanished — <strong>it has relocated</strong>. The emergence of new hotspots signals a quiet reshaping of urban risk.
  </p>

    </p>
  </div>


  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    While hotspots highlight shifts at the neighborhood level, they don’t tell the full story. 
    Crime in San Francisco is also shaped by how the city is organized and patrolled — through its official police districts.
    These districts serve as the operational units for law enforcement, budgeting, and community engagement.
    So, to truly understand how crime is distributed and responded to, we must examine patterns at the district level.
  </p>

  <h2>District Disparities: Mapping the Weight of Crime</h2>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    San Francisco’s police districts aren’t just administrative borders — they shape how the city enforces safety and allocates resources.
    <strong>From 2003 to 2024, the data shows stark disparities.</strong> Southern, Central, Northern, and Mission districts consistently record the highest crime loads,
    with Southern emerging as a particularly overburdened hotspot.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    <strong>The nature of crimes also varies</strong>: larceny, vehicle theft, and burglary dominate citywide, while drug violations peak in Tenderloin,
    and robbery/assault persist in Mission and Northern. Conversely, districts like Park, Richmond, and Taraval see lower crime totals,
    though they’re not immune.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    <strong>This spatial imbalance is more than statistical — it reflects real differences in safety and service.</strong>
    As San Francisco plans for policing and reform, <strong>district-level inequities must be central to that conversation.</strong>

  <h2>What the News Is Saying</h2>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The trends we found in the data closely align with recent reporting on crime in San Francisco. Our analysis shows that
  <strong>crime peaked in 2017 and dropped significantly after 2020</strong>, particularly during the COVID-19 lockdown.
  This pattern is echoed by a article from the 
  <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/crime/article/sf-bipping-car-break-ins-20246260.php" target="_blank" style="color: #003366; text-decoration: underline;">
    San Francisco Chronicle
  </a>, which highlights that property crimes reached their highest point in 2017 and have declined since then.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Interestingly, this downward trend occurred <strong>even as police staffing levels hit historic lows</strong>.
  <a href="https://missionlocal.org/2025/02/san-francisco-crime-police-staffing/" target="_blank" style="color: #003366; text-decoration: underline;">
    Mission Local
  </a> reported that despite a drop in officer numbers, San Francisco’s overall crime rate continued to decline.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Our hotspot analysis also revealed that areas like <strong>Tenderloin and Mission remain persistent hotspots</strong>.
  Local reporting supports this as well: an article from the 
  <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/sf/article/16th-mission-district-20071953.php" target="_blank" style="color: #003366; text-decoration: underline;">
    San Francisco Chronicle
  </a> notes that when police intensify enforcement in the Tenderloin, crime often shifts into the Mission District.
  Another article highlights how open-air drug market locations have shifted — 
  <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/crime/article/sf-bipping-car-break-ins-20246260.php" target="_blank" style="color: #003366; text-decoration: underline;">
    reflecting our finding that crime has not disappeared, but moved.
  </a>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  <strong>These news stories help validate what we observed in the data:</strong> overall crime in San Francisco has declined,
  but the change has not been uniform. Some neighborhoods continue to face long-standing challenges, and shifts in crime often reflect
  both local policy decisions and the changing dynamics of urban life.
</p>

  


<h2>Conclusion: Not Just Safer — But for Whom?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The patterns revealed in our data aren’t just analytical — they’re reflected in what’s happening on the ground.
  <strong>News articles and community reports echo the same story:</strong> San Francisco’s crime landscape has changed — not just in scale, but in shape.
  The city has seen a meaningful decline in focus crimes since the 2017 peak, with the pandemic marking a sharp turning point.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  But <strong>this progress hasn’t been evenly felt.</strong> Some neighborhoods have shown lasting improvement. Others remain persistently impacted.
  And in a few areas, new challenges are emerging. <strong>Crime hasn’t disappeared — it’s shifted.</strong>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  At the district level, the story becomes even clearer. <strong>A small number of areas continue to carry a disproportionate share of the city’s crime burden.</strong>
  These differences reflect more than just statistics — they speak to deeper questions about how safety, resources, and responsibility are distributed across a growing city.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  <strong>This is not just a story of crime reduction — it’s about how risk and accountability are distributed in a changing city.</strong>
  Understanding San Francisco’s crime trends means looking beyond the numbers — recognizing where progress has taken hold, and where more attention is still needed.
  <strong>Because while overall crime is down, for many communities, the need for safety, equity, and support is still ongoing.</strong>
