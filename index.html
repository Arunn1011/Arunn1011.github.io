  <h1>How Safe Is San Francisco Now?</h1>
  <p><em>A 20-Year Crime Retrospective</em></p>

  <section>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      Crime often feels like a constant. But <strong>has San Francisco actually become more or less dangerous over time?</strong> 
      Using over two decades of crime data, we explore how patterns have shifted — both in terms of volume and geography. 
      This story draws on a publicly available dataset from the San Francisco Police Department, covering over 20 years 
      of reported crimes from 2003 to 2024. The dataset includes incident-level records with information on date, time, 
      location, police district, and crime category. 
      <strong>We focus on “focus crimes” — such as assault, burglary, robbery, larceny/theft, drug violations, and other high-impact offenses.</strong>
      By analyzing these incidents across time and space, we aim to understand how the city’s safety landscape has evolved — 
      and where risk still lingers.

    <h2>Total Reported Crime by Year</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      Over the past two decades, San Francisco's reported focus crimes have followed a trajectory that tells a deeper story. 
      <strong>In 2017, these crimes peaked — recording just over 90,000 incidents.</strong> It was a year marked by intense housing 
      pressures, growing inequality, and shifting enforcement priorities. 
      <strong>This spike raises questions: Was it a true surge in crime or a reflection of evolving reporting practices?</strong> 
      Regardless, 2017 remains the city's most crime-heavy year in two decades.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      What followed was unexpected. Crime began to decline after 2017, and by 2020, it plunged. 
      <strong>This sharp drop coincided with the COVID-19 pandemic</strong> — a time when life paused, public spaces emptied, and 
      crime opportunities diminished. But was this just a blip?
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Crime Trends After 2017</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      <strong>The data shows the dip in 2020 wasn't just temporary.</strong> While other cities saw crime rebound post-pandemic, 
      San Francisco’s focus crime numbers remained lower. 
      <strong>By 2024, they had dropped by over 33% from the 2017 peak.</strong>
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      This trend raises important questions: Has the city truly become safer? Are long-term policies, technological interventions, 
      or community efforts paying off? Or is it simply a change in how crime is reported and classified? 
      <strong>Though the dataset alone can’t offer definitive answers, one thing is clear: San Francisco’s crime rates are trending downward — steadily.</strong>
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      But if overall crime is falling, where is it still happening? <strong>To answer that, we need to look beyond timelines — and examine the map.</strong>

    <h2>Where is Crime Concentrated in the City?</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      <strong>While overall crime has declined, the geography of crime tells a more nuanced story.</strong> 
      This map compares geolocated incidents from 2017 and 2024, categorizing them into:
    </p>
    <ul style="text-align: justify;">
      <li><strong>Persistent hotspots</strong> – Crime reported in both years</li>
      <li><strong>Improved areas</strong> – Crime only reported in 2017</li>
      <li><strong>Newly unsafe zones</strong> – Crime only reported in 2024</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      <strong>Downtown areas like the Tenderloin, SoMa, and eastern Mission remain persistent hotspots,</strong> while 
      other neighborhoods show improvement or newly emerging concerns.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Spatial Patterns of Change</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      The Mission continues to struggle — appearing as a persistent hotspot. In contrast, the Richmond, Sunset, and southern 
      residential districts show real progress, with fewer reported incidents in 2024. 
      <strong>However, crime hasn’t disappeared — it has shifted.</strong>
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      New hotspots are emerging in areas like the northern waterfront, Bayview, and peripheral zones. 
      <strong>This suggests a reshaping of risk, not its elimination.</strong> These shifts highlight the need for evolving policy responses.
    </p>

    </p>
  </div>

  <section>
    <h2>District Disparities: Mapping the Weight of Crime</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      <strong>Crime patterns differ dramatically across police districts.</strong> The Tenderloin and Southern districts consistently bear 
      a disproportionate share of reported incidents, while areas like Richmond and Taraval remain relatively calm.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      <strong>These disparities shape officer deployment, public perception, and policymaking.</strong> Understanding where crime concentrates 
      is essential for distributing resources fairly and crafting responsive strategies.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion: The Shape of Safety</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      <strong>San Francisco's crime landscape is changing — in volume, in space, and in complexity.</strong> While the data shows a hopeful 
      decline in focus crime over 20 years, it also reveals neighborhoods still under pressure and new ones emerging as risk zones.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      <strong>The city's safety story is not just about statistics — it's about geography.</strong> And understanding those geographies is 
      key to building a safer, more equitable San Francisco.
